## Introduction
![Ordioplay Image](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*EtaqlNQMtgtclAOQx7My9w.png)

The application helps Users to get the audio of social media and YouTube videos in audio form only. It also allows for streaming of the videos. The project was supposed to be handled by a group of persons but it turned out that I did it singlehandedly. My focus was to develop a web application that helps get the audio of the videos that I want to watch without having to utilize several gigabytes while watching the video especially for videos that the entire message been conveyed does not depend on the pictorial views.

For me, I love listening to music and some of these music are in video form. Except for the use of Spotify, Audiomack etc., my next option is music videos hence when a need to build a Portfolio Project came up, I decided to use the ample opportunity to satisfy my want.
